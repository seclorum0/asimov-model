## 🎯 How Can I Contribute?

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs
- Check if the bug has already been reported in Issues

3. Make your changes
4. Add or update tests (we need to make sure robots behave!)

6. Commit (`git commit -m 'Add some cool feature'`)

### 🎭 Adding Humorous Responses

We love new sarcastic responses! But please keep them:
